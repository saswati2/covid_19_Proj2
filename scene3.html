          Detailed observations on the trendline graph showing total reported deaths for COVID-19 cases for the top 5 countries (US, India, Germany, France, Brazil):

       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        1. The death toll trends for all five countries indicate significant increases starting from early 2020, aligning with the global spread of COVID-19.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. The steepness of the curves before and after the annotated point shows the critical periods of the pandemic waves and the responses to mitigate the death toll.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Each country's curve shows different patterns of rise and flattening, reflecting the varied impact of COVID-19 variants and the effectiveness of public health measures.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. The "Flattening the curve" annotation marks a key point where the rate of increase in deaths began to slow down, showing the impact of public health measures and vaccination efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. Despite the general flattening observed post-2022, there were so many deaths over the years, underscoring the severe impact of one of the biggest pandemics the world has ever seen.
