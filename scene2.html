      <p class="lead">Though the first case of Covid-19 was reported back in 2019, it has started impacted from mid
        March, 2020 around the world. Today <mark>US</mark>, <mark>Brazil</mark>, <mark>India</mark>,
        <mark>Russia</mark> and <mark>South Africa</mark> have most number of confirmed cases.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">This line graph helps to find out the pattern of growing number of Covid 19 confirmed cases for
        those 5 countries
      </p>
      <p class="lead">It has five lines one for each country. Color legends are added for visual affordance. The graphs
        load in the page in an animated way. It is clearly visible that US is in 2nd wave and other countries in the top
        five list are still in fisrt wave. This is marked by annotation as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Following observations can be easily inferred:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        1. US is in already 2nd wave as the line curve representing the total number
        of confirmed cases was having flattening trend around mid-May, 2020 and it
        is again gaining its momentum since mid-June, 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Brazil, India and South Africa have not reached to its first peak yet as
        the line curves representing the total number of confirmed cases are
        showing continuous upward trend with no sign of flattening of the curve.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. The line curve representing total number of confirmed cases for Russia is
        showing the sign of flattening the curve. It is still in first wave though.
