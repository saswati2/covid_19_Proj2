        multiple lines and scatterplot which have been created using D3.js.

        This narrative visualization has been created to find out following
        (utilizing data available till 03/09/2023):
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Top 50 COVID-19 infected countries
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Growing trend of total number of Confirmed cases of COVID-19 for top 5
        infected countries
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Growing trend of total number of Deaths due to COVID-19 for top 5

        <strong>Narrative Visualization</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This interractive slideshow visualization structure begins with an author-driven
        approach, initially using following scenes:
      </p>
      
      
     
      <p>
        
        Once the authorâ€™s intended narrative (guided journey) is complete to find
        out <strong>Top 50 infected countries</strong>,
        <strong>
          growing trend of total number of confirmed cases and deaths
        </strong>
        for top 5 infected countries, the visualization opens to a reader-driven
        stage where the user is free to interactively explore the data.
