      <h3>About the Visualization</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Overview</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Started back in Dec, 2019, COVID-19 has spread out each and every countries
        around the world. The Martini Glass visualization structure is used to tell
        the story for the impact as on 07/22/2020.
      </p>
      <p>
        The D3 JavaScript library in combination with HTML and CSS are utilized to
        create the visualization. The publicly available data has been downloaded
        and referenced from HTML and JavaScript files. The data visualization
        components in this content are animated bar-chart, line graphs with
        multiple lines and scatterplot which have been created using D3.js.
      </p>
      <p>
        This narrative visualization has been created to find out following
        (utilizing data available till 07/22/2020):
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Top 50 COVID-19 infected countries
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Growing trend of total number of Confirmed cases of COVID-19 for top 5
        infected countries
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Growing trend of total number of Deaths due to COVID-19 for top 5
        infected countries
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Correlation between Total number of confirmed cases, recovered cases,
        deaths due to COVID-19 and Population, Income, Region of the different
        countries around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Narrative Visualization</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This Martini Glass visualization structure begins with an author-driven
        approach, initially using following scenes:
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>Home Page: </u>
        This first page sets the context and provides the pictorial representation
        of total number of confirmed cases for top 50 infected countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>Confirmed Cases Page:</u>
        This is the 2<sup>nd</sup> scene which provides visual animated
        representation of growing trend of COVID-19 confirmed cases for top 5 most
        infected countries namely US, Brazil, India, Russia and South Africa. The
        annotation has been used to clearly mark the trend pattern. The country
        specific color scheme has been used to aid the users to understand the
        chart better. Following observations can be easily inferred:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. US is in already 2nd wave as the line curve representing the total number
        of confirmed cases was having flattening trend around mid-May, 2020 and it
        is again gaining its momentum since mid-June, 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Brazil, India and South Africa have not reached to its first peak yet as
        the line curves representing the total number of confirmed cases are
        showing continuous upward trend with no sign of flattening of the curve.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. The line curve representing total number of confirmed cases for Russia is
        showing the sign of flattening the curve. It is still in first wave though.
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>Deaths Page:</u>
        This is 3<sup>rd</sup> scene which provides the trend of total deaths of
        COVID-19 in those top 5 infected countries since its inception. Same
        annotation style and country specific color scheme have been used to aid
        the users. Following observations can ben easily interred through this
        page:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Second Wave of Deaths has been started in US around mid-June 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Countries (Brazil, India and South Africa) which are in first wave in
        terms of total number of confirmed cases (as depicted in scene 2), are in
        first wave in terms of total number of Death as well. Russia has shown the
        sign of flattening the curve for the first wave in terms of total number of
        deaths.
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>Final Page:</u>
        Once the authorâ€™s intended narrative (guided journey) is complete to find
        out <strong>Top 50 infected countries</strong>,
        <strong>
          growing trend of total number of confirmed cases and deaths
        </strong>
        for top 5 infected countries, the visualization opens to a reader-driven
        stage where the user is free to interactively explore the data. The <u>Final Page</u> is a chance for the user
        to explore the correlation
        between Total number of confirmed cases, recovered cases, deaths and
        Population, Income, Region of the countries.
